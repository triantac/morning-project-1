                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">The Coronavirus Pandemic poses a number of threats to our physical,
                    social and emotional
                    wellbeing.
                    The aim of this website is to provide people with the resources that they need to manage their
                    mental health at home during this very difficult time.
                </h3><br>
                <img id="centeri" src="img/mental.jpg" width="100%" alt="mental health" title="Mental health"><br>
                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">Breathing exercises</h3>
                <p>In fight or flight mode our breathing speeds up, so to flip back into rest and
                    digest mode, we need to slow our breathing down. On top of this when we’re in
                    fight or flight we focus on getting oxygen in, and not on getting waste gases out,
                    so breathing out for longer than we breathe in can help to counter-balance this. </p><br>
                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">Slow it down and use your diaphragm</h3>
                <p>
                    Try breathing in through your nose for 6 seconds and then out through your
                    mouth for 8*. You can do this sat in a chair or lying down.
                    Once you’ve got that then focus on making each breath really deep. Try putting
                    your hands near the top of your stomach, just at the bottom of your rib cage
                    where your diaphragm is, and concentrate on making your abdomen expand as
                    you breathe in. Then as you breathe out let it relax to normal again. For each breath focus on
                    this
                    movement until you are naturally breathing slower
                    and deeper.
                </p><br>
                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">Focus your attention</h3>
                <p>Next you can try counting down your breathing as a meditative practice. Focus
                    on what each breath feels like- the movement of your stomach, and your
                    shoulders, the sounds you make breathing, the feel of air rushing in through your
                    nose and out of your mouth. Notice the change in temperature between air
                    coming in and out. See if you can trace the feeling of the air through your wind
                    pipes. As you focus all of your attention on your breathing start to count down
                    from 30 with each breath. If you lose focus and your mind wonders, or if you
                    forget what number you were on then just return to 30 and try again. You will
                    find it is very difficult to get down to 0 but it will help focus your attention away
                    from your worries and slow your heart-rate and breathing! This exercise can be
                    particularly helpful when trying to get to sleep.</p><br>
                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h3>
                <p>When we are anxious and in fight or flight mode we tend to tense our muscles,
                    often without even noticing. In order to shift back into rest and digest mode we
                    might need to purposefully relax our muscles. One very effective way of doing
                    this is to work through each muscle group in your body clenching those muscles
                    as much as you can for 10-20 seconds and then completely releasing them. If
                    you try this with your shoulders now you will probably find that they drop lower
                    than they were before you clenched them! Try lying down and work through your
                    muscles in the order below. Do just one area at a time but tense as much as you
                    can.</p><br>
                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">Grounding exercises</h3>
                <p>Grounding is a term for bringing ourselves back into the present when we start
                    to feel emotionally overwhelmed and out of control. Anxiety can often make us
                    feel like this, and it often goes with thoughts like ‘I can’t cope with this anymore’
                    and ‘I don’t know what to do’. It also often goes hand in hand with tearfulness,
                    breathing very quickly, or starting to feel nauseous. If you find yourself feeling
                    like this it can be really scary, so make sure you know what your most effective
                    grounding strategies are early on and then write it on a post-it note to remind
                    you if you start to get overwhelmed. Below are some ideas of things that other
                    people find work for them:</p><br>
                <p><b>A strong smell like smelling salts, or essential oils</b><br>The part of the brain
                    related to smell is really close to the part of the brain associated with fear
                    and emotional memories. If we are imagining bad things that could
                    happen in the future, or remembering something upsetting that has
                    already happened, a strong smell that wouldn’t be present in those
                    imagined/remembered situations can help bring us back into the present.
                    If you’re in self-isolation you might use spices that you already have in the
                    cupboard, or ask a friend or neighbour if they could pick you up a bottle
                    of essential oils and drop them through your letterbox!<br></p>
                <p><b>A strong taste</b> - by the same logic taste can help us to ‘snap out of’
                    memories or imagined situations that are upsetting. Sour sweets or a hot
                    chili sauce can work.<br>
                    <b>A tactile object</b> - having a stress ball to squeeze,
                    beads on a string that you can move up or
                    down, a bouncy ball to throw and catch, a soft
                    blanket to stroke, or any other tactile object that
                    you can interact with to keep you focussed on
                    the present can help. It can be particularly
                    helpful if the object is associated with positive
                    memories, i.e. a shell from a beach where you
                    went on holiday, or a gift from a friend.</p>
                <p><b>A photograph</b> - sometimes it can be helpful to
                    ground
                    ourselves by
                    remembering what we have in the present. During self-isolation you might
                    not get to see all of your favourite people, but remembering that they’re
                    there and they still love you is important. Keep a photo of the people you
                    can’t be with right now to focus in on if you start to feel overwhelmed,
                    and once you’ve got your breathing in order and are feeling a bit better,
                    why not pick up the phone to them or give them a video call?<br>
                    <b>5, 4, 3, 2, 1</b> - this is a simple grounding exercise that can be done
                    anywhere and there are five steps:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Notice 5 things you can see right now- things close to you, further
                        away, out of the window. Notice them in detail, name their shapes and
                        colours in your head.</li>
                    <li>Notice 4 things you can hear- again some things might be outside,
                        some might be inside, some might even be in your own body.</li>
                    <li>Notice 3 things you can feel- it might be the pressure of your back and
                        bum on your seat, or feet on the ground (this can be helpful as it’s a
                        reminder that we are always physically grounded). You might notice
                        the feel of clothes on your skin, or your temperature, or the feel of air
                        moving in and out of your lungs.</li>
                    <li>Notice 2 things you can smell- this can be difficult, but often our own
                        clothes keep a smell, or we might smell food or an air freshener.</li>
                    <li>Notice 1 thing you can taste- this can be very hard as we rarely focus
                        on taste unless we’re eating, but have a go at just focusing on your
                        taste sense for a bit and see what you notice.<br>
                        <b>Physical grounding</b> - when we are really overwhelmed we often feel a bit
                        nauseous and weak and want to sit down and shut our eyes, but if we can
                        make ourselves use our muscles and have to focus our physical energy on
                        something in the present, this can be a very effective way of grounding.
                        Two helpful ways to do this are planking, or a wall-sit (see pictures below).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">‘Don’t Worry’</h3>
                <p>As many of us well know this is easier said than done, especially when you’re
                    spending lots of time on your own! If you are struggling to find things other than
                    your worries about coronavirus to focus on, see the resource for ‘what to do
                    when the worrying gets too much’.</p><br>
                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">Rescources for children</h3>
                <P>Simple tips on how to talk to kids about the corona virus:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be calm, honest, and informed.</li>
                    <li>Tailor your approach based on your child—think about whether more information makes them
                        more or
                        less anxious.</li>
                    <li>Share facts simply and calmly—kids take their cue from you.</li>
                    <li>Ask your child what they know, answer their questions and address any misinformation.

                    </li>
                    <li>Validate their feelings, while reassuring them- “I understand this can be scary. The risk is
                        still low, and we’re well prepared."</li>
                    <li>Remind them of what’s in their power—washing hands thoroughly and often, coughing and
                        sneezing
                        into their elbow, getting plenty of sleep, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As we have already mentioned in our Guidelines page, setting up routines and being empathetic is
                    key
                    to dealing with kids and COVID-19. We do understand that finding suitable resources to establish
                    such routines might be difficult. Below, you will find some ideas as to what you can do to keep
                    your
                    children entertained, informed, and feeling safe. As always, we remain open to your suggestions.
                </p><br>
                <h3 class="mentalbold mentaltext">Hand-washing routines</h3>
                <p>Despite being considered generally easy, establishing a solid hand-washing routine might take
                    more
                    time
                    than expected. Keep in mind the tips below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Teach children to wash hands after sneezing, coughing or blowing noses, before touching
                        food,
                        after going to the toilet, after being in public places, and after being around sick people.
                    </li>
                    <li>A regular and consistent hand-washing routine can help young children remember to wash.
                        Singing
                        a song can help children wash for 20 seconds. It also makes hand-washing fun!</li>
                    <li>Be a good hand-washing and hygiene role model. Children and teenagers are more likely to
                        have
                        good hand hygiene if they see you leading by example.</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>
