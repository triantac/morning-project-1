                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Make a schedule for you and your children that has time for

                                            <li>Teach your child aboutkeeping safe distances. You can reassure
                                                your child by talking about how you are keeping safe.Listen to
                                                their suggestions and take them seriously.</li>
                                            <li>Make a 20-second song for washing hands. Add actions! Give
                                                children points and praise for regular handwashing.</li>
                                            <li>Talk through the effects of challenging behaviour. Decide
                                                together on clear and fair rules and boundaries.</li>
                                            <li>Strengthen routines. Use simple language and clearinstructions
                                                and nonverbalcommunication for children whoneed it (for example:
                                                gestures,pictures, and visual aids).</li>

                                        </ol><br>
                                        <strong>Don't:</strong><br>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Avoid responsibilities. Engage your children in daily life and
                                                challenges. Allow them to make mistakes and learn as they go.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Focus on the negatives; reinforce the positives instead! This is
                                                a very stressful period for everyone. Make sure that positivity
                                                is still in place.</li>
                                            <li>Be afraid to ask for help. Your family, local community, and
                                                health providers are always here to help. Seek mental support if
                                                needed.</li>
